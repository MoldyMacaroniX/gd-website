RobTop has released a new Geometry Dash 2.2 sneak peek, showcasing the level "Explorers." This is the second 2.2 level showcased so far.

Being first previewed over five years ago [with this image](https://imgur.com/a/4ccvsBW), RobTop has [finally previewed](https://youtu.be/CtEQ_EGlbQc) this half-a-decade old level. However, what previous 2.2 leaks shows us is that this level was only started very recently.

Many of the features it uses, such as the spider orbs, keyframes, and new animations were only developed recently. RobTop [also confirmed this](https://twitter.com/today_gd/status/1566908093388443648) when he posted about it on the Geometry Dash Discord server.

The image he shares while saying this is unrelated.

Now, we have two sneak peeks. The update has to be close, right? So when is Geometry Dash 2.2 coming out?

# When is Geometry Dash 2.2 coming out?

This is a hard question to answer due to how little we know about the inner workings of the update, but Geometry Dash 2.2 will likely release in about 2-12 months from now.

If RobTop is only fixing bugs and finished the two new levels, then we can likely see the update out in a couple months. But if he still has core parts of the game to develop such as the new level editor, we could be waiting upwards of a year depending on how long he takes.

One thing is for certain, though. RobTop is aware that 2.2 has taken way too long, and is doing his best to get the update out as soon as possible. Who knows? Maybe 2.2 will release before Christmas!
