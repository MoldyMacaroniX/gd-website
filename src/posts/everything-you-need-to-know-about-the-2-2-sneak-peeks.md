RobTop released a new Geometry Dash 2.2 preview, showcasing the new 2.2 keyframe system. Ever wanted to animate objects in Geometry Dash easily? Now you can!

Before, making animated objects wasn't easy. There were two methods: making each frame or using a bunch of trigger hacks. The first method required too many objects, and the second method didn't have as many possibilities. With this new system, creators can create complex animations without so many objects using an easy-to-grasph keyframe interface.

Take a look for yourself!
