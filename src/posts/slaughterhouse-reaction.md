Slaughterhouse is one of the most popular level in Geometry Dash. It has a long history and it is one of the worst experiences in any extreme demons in the game.
On the 9th of April 2022, TheZinkYT, a former Geometry Dash Demon List Moderators, raided a Getting Over It streamer on Twitch named GFMBadger after the latter asked to Badger "what does Geometry Dash look like today". GFMBadger decided to watch a Slaughterhouse completion video on stream, during which he reacted IcEDCave part (from 18-49%) with visible amazement. He also jokingly asks questions "Are these spikes in the dark?", whilst reacting to the hardest level.

On April 11, the clip of GFMBadger reacting to Slaughterhouse would be re-posted by TheZinkYT himself, on his Twitter. The [tweet](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/2161/iKrBmH.png) gained over 1500 likes!
Shortly after the tweet went viral, [GFMBadger jokingly said that he will need to do a Geometry Dash stream](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5545/T24e4H.png), but he didn't get the time to play the game.

So, this isn’t the first time a non-GD player has looked at a hard map from the game.
Geometry Dash players looking at their home pages on YouTube probably know the Geometry Dash YouTuber EidamGD which went viral among the Geometry Dash communtiy for posting the first video ever of non-GD players ranking and reacting at some Extreme Demons. This became later a YouTube trend where non-GD players would guess Extreme Demons like mentionned, take a Geometry Dash exam with questions about the game etc. Here’s an example of video that non-GD players react to challenge list levels, and try to rank them, by difficulty, from 1 to 10.
