Excluding specific circumstances, citing your sources is **not** required. For most articles, you probably do not even need to cite anything. However, if your article has a lot of research, providing sources is not a bad idea.

# How to cite your sources

There are two ways to cite sources.

## Method 1

The first and recommended way is to simply use links. For example, take a look at the following sentence.

```md
1st Level by Real Storm is the first uploaded level and was released back in 2013.
```

To cite your sources, simply turn your facts into links. For the above example, "first uploaded level" and "back in 2013" can become links to the sources of information.

```md
1st Level by Real Storm is the [first uploaded level](https://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/3029/first-online-level-geometry-dash) and was released [back in 2013](https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Geometry_Dash).
```

The above example is using markdown syntax (if you don't know what that means, don't worry) but in a regular document editor it will look like this:

"1st Level by Real Storm is the [first uploaded level](https://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/3029/first-online-level-geometry-dash) and was released [back in 2013](https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Geometry_Dash)."

## Method 2

The second method is to provide your sources at the end of your article in a "sources" section. This is not recommended.

This method does have some disadvantages.

* It doesn't tell which facts use which sources.
* An entire section dedicated to sources often prevents users from seeing the "up next" articles.

To get around the first disadvantage, you should provide your sources in an ordered list and reference the list item number in your article. For example, take a look at the following example.

```md
1st Level by Real Storm is the first uploaded level and was released back in 2013.

# Sources

1. https://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/3029/first-online-level-geometry-dash
2. https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Geometry_Dash
```

If you think it is necessary, provide a reference to the sources list.

```md
1st Level by Real Storm is the first uploaded level (1) and was released back in 2013 (2).

# Sources

1. https://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/3029/first-online-level-geometry-dash
2. https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Geometry_Dash
```

Currently, this website does not support superscripts.

# When to cite a source

If a fact is considered **common knowledge**, it probably does not need a source. These usually include simple facts like the following examples:

* "Stereo Madness is the first official level"
* "RobTop is the creator of Geometry Dash"
* "Viprin is number one on the creators leaderboard"

In general, assume your reader has basic knowledge of well-known levels, players, and YouTubers.

Just because you think you know a fact doesn't mean it is common knowledge. In general, all bold claims should be sourced properly, like the following examples:

* "In order to become an in-game mod, you need to have connections"
* "1st Level by Real Storm is the first uploaded level"
* "Chill Out by TheRealDarnoc is the first rated level"
* "Collaboration was the first collab"

# Why you should cite your sources

While citing your sources is not mandatory (except for specific circumstances), doing so has some benefits.

* If a fact you use is wrong, you will be less at blame. There are lots of common misconceptions around the community. Did you know that some of the facts used as examples above are wrong?
* It can provide extra context to the reader.
* The article will generally be considered of a higher quality, which might increase its chances at being published or featured.

# Recommended sources

Here are some recommended sources for citing your facts.

* Geometry Dash Wiki pages
* Geometry Dash Forums
* YouTube videos
* Tweets
* A level's or creator's GDBrowser page
* Official statements from players

# When you are required to cite a source

1. If the source you are using *requires* being properly credited, you are by extension required to credit it.
2. All direct quotations or severe paraphrasing *must* be properly cited.
