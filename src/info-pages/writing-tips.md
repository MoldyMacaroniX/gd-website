There are some common errors throughout submitted articles that make editing increasingly harder. To increase the chances of your article being published, please try to fix these. These are common amongst both native and non-native English speakers, so do not worry if you are still learning English; you will still find these tips useful.

# Run-on sentences

Let's take a look at the following (mostly unedited) excerpt from a submitted article.

> It is also a very intense part, and it's had its history of being harder than the first half of the level, but that has been changed and Kaito updated it and nerfed the second half so it would be balanced and enjoyable.

This is a very long sentence, or what is called a "run-on" sentence. To fix it, simply break it up into multiple sentences, like the example below.

> It is also a very intense part. While it's had its history of being harder than the first half of the level, that has been changed as Kaito updated it. He nerfed the second half so it would be balanced and enjoyable.

# Repetition

The following (mostly unedited) excerpt from a submitted article shows too much repetition.

> In 2021, Geometry Dash YouTube content went through lots of trends throughout the year.

Notice the section "went through lots of trends throughout the year." This is directly repeating itself as well as repeating "in 2021." Simply fix this by removing the repetition.

> In 2021, Geometry Dash YouTube content went through lots of trends.

<!-- The following (mostly unedited) excerpt from a submitted article shows too much repetition.

> Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added to the game, like the new camera triggers and two new gamemodes (swing copter and platformer mode).

First, both "the game" is a repeat of "Geometry Dash" (both bolded below).

> __Geometry Dash__ update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added to __the game__, like the new camera triggers and two new gamemodes (swing copter and platformer mode).

"The game" is redundant, as the reader was already told the game ("Geometry Dash"). Instead, that can be cut out.

> Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added, like the new camera triggers and two new gamemodes (swing copter and platformer mode).

Similarly, the "swing copter and platformer mode" is a repeat of "two new gamemodes" (both bolded below).

> Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added, like the new camera triggers and __two new gamemodes__ (__swing copter and platformer mode__).

Simply remove one of the bolded instances above. In this case, it is probably best to keep the second bold instance ("swing copter and platformer mode") as it contains the most detail.

> Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added, like the new camera triggers, swing copter, and platformer mode. -->

# Uncertainty

Many submitted articles, such as the following (mostly unedited) excerpt, contains uncertainty.

> **I think** Geometry Dash update 2.2 will be a revolutionary update because of the amazing features being added to the game.

Using "I think" (bolded above) suggests that you are not certain about your argument, which does not make for a very compelling article.

Rather than using an uncertain tone, use "in my opinion" instead. However, this should only ever be used in a section of your article that is opinionated, such as when:

1. It is not clear that this section is opinionated.
2. It is an opinionated section of an otherwise factual article.

Do not use "in my opinion" when presenting a core argument your article is based on.
