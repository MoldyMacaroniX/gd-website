# 🌟 Geometry Dash Website Project

This is the source code for my Geometry Dash website project

## 📗 Documentation

For a documentation on how content is written and managed, see [dashword.net/handbook/](https://www.dashword.net/handbook/).

## 🛠️ Built With

* Built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/),
* on top of [Vredeburg](https://github.com/dafiulh/vredeburgm).

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/gd-website.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run Eleventy
   ```sh
   npx eleventy --serve
   ```
This will create an instance at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

Alternatively, you can run the `install.bat` file to install the NPM packages and then run `run.bat` to run Eleventy. This is an option better for those less familiar with the command line.
